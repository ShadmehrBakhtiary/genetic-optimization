# Genetic Algorithm for Neural Network Optimization

## Introduction

Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are search and optimization techniques inspired by the process of natural selection and genetics. They belong to the broader class of evolutionary algorithms and are designed to mimic the process of natural selection to find optimal solutions to complex problems. Genetic algorithms are widely used in various fields, including machine learning, optimization, and artificial intelligence.

In a genetic algorithm, a population of candidate solutions (individuals) evolves over multiple generations. Each individual represents a potential solution to the problem being optimized. The algorithm uses genetic operators such as selection, crossover, and mutation to generate new individuals in each generation based on the fittest individuals from the previous generation.

## Applications of Genetic Algorithms

Genetic algorithms have been applied to a wide range of optimization and search problems in different domains. Some of the common applications of genetic algorithms include:

1. **Function Optimization**: Genetic algorithms are used to optimize complex mathematical functions with a large search space, where traditional optimization techniques may struggle.

2. **Machine Learning**: Genetic algorithms can be applied to optimize the structure and parameters of machine learning models, such as neural networks, to improve their performance on tasks like classification and regression.

3. **Feature Selection**: Genetic algorithms are used to select subsets of important features from a high-dimensional dataset, which can improve the efficiency and accuracy of machine learning models.

4. **Control Systems**: Genetic algorithms are used in control systems to optimize parameters and configurations for optimal system performance in industries like robotics, automation, and process control.

5. **Scheduling and Routing Problems**: Genetic algorithms are employed to solve complex scheduling and routing problems in logistics, transportation, and resource allocation.

6. **Bioinformatics**: Genetic algorithms are used in bioinformatics for tasks like sequence alignment, protein structure prediction, and genetic sequence analysis.


# Genetic Algorithm for Neural Network Optimization

This project implements a genetic algorithm for optimizing the weights of a neural network model for digit recognition using the MNIST dataset. The genetic algorithm is used to train a population of neural networks, evaluate their performance, and evolve them over multiple generations to improve accuracy.

## Project Structure

- `Network.py`: Defines a neural network model with convolutional and dense layers for digit recognition. Includes methods for training, testing, and manipulating weights of the model.
- `GeneticAlgorithm.py`: Implements the genetic algorithm for optimizing the weights of the neural network models. It includes functions for creating a population, training the models, evaluating performance, evolving through mutation and reproduction, and running the evolution process.
- `Main.py`: Main script that initializes the genetic algorithm with specified parameters, creates the initial population, and runs the evolution process.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Tensorflow (for neural network model)

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies by running: `pip install numpy matplotlib tensorflow`.
2. Run the `Main.py` script to start the genetic algorithm optimization process.
3. Adjust the hyperparameters in the `GeneticAlgorithm` class to fine-tune the algorithm and improve performance.
4. Monitor the training process and evaluate the accuracy of the evolved neural network models.
5. The final output will be a plot showing the accuracy history of each network in the population over the generations.

## Further Improvements

1. Experiment with different hyperparameters (population size, mutation rate, generations) to optimize the genetic algorithm.
2. Implement different selection methods and crossover strategies for reproduction.
3. Extend the project to work with other datasets and neural network architectures.
4. Add logging and metrics tracking to monitor the evolution process and network performance.
